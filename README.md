Article Reliability and Bias Scores
------------

The article reliability and bias scores used to classify articles when training the model, as well as the articles themselves, are from an interactive media bias chart found [here](https://ichart.vercel.app/) (or [here](https://www.adfontesmedia.com/interactive-media-bias-chart-2/) if the first link does not work for some reason). These two classifiers, or labels, are measured on the following scales:

##### Reliability
- 0.0 to 8.0 - Contains Inaccurate / Fabricated Information
- 8.0 to 16.0 - Propaganda / Contains Misleading Information
- 16.0 to 24.0 - Selective or Incomplete Story / Unfair Persuasion
- 24.0 to 32.0 - Opinion or High Variation in Reliability
- 32.0 to 40.0 - Analysis or High Variation in Reliability
- 40.0 to 48.0 - Complex Analysis or Mix of Fact Reporting and Analysis
- 48.0 to 56.0 - Fact Reporting
- 56.0 to 64.0 - Original Fact Reporting

##### Bias
- -42.0 to -30.0 - Most Extreme Left
- -30.0 to -18.0 - Hyper-Partisan Left
- -18.0 to -6.0 - Skews Left
- -6.0 to 6.0 - Neutral or Balanced Bias
- 6.0 to 18.0 - Skews Right
- 18.0 to 30.0 - Hyper-Partisan Right
- 30.0 to 42.0 - Most Extreme Right
