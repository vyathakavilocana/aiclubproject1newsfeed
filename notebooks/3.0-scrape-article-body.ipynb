      "South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said at Thursday’s LGBTQ town hall that he would overhaul rules that prevent gay men who have been sexually active within the last year from donating blood.\n",
      "The 2020 Democrat, who is the first openly gay man to run for president, was asked at the town hall hosted by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign what he would do about the Food and Drug Administration’s blood donation policy that prohibits cis men who have had sex with cis men in the past 12 months from giving blood.\n",
      "Buttigieg responded by speaking about his own experience as a gay man leading South Bend’s annual blood drive.\n",
      "“I remember the moment when I realized that, unlike most initiatives that I spearhead, I can’t lead by example on this one, because my blood’s not welcome in this country,” he said. “And it’s not based on science; it’s based on prejudice.”\n",
      "Pete Buttigieg on the prohibition on gay men donating blood: “My blood is not welcome in this country. And it's not based on science. It's based on prejudice.“ #EqualityTownHall https://t.co/6B3kdrsPpk pic.twitter.com/CVKJu9Ywm1— CNN (@CNN) October 11, 2019\n",
      "The mayor said as president he would have the FDA revise its rules “based on evidence, based on individual risk factors and without regard to the prejudice that has driven the current policy.”\n",
      "Buttigieg’s appearance Thursday night in Los Angeles was a historic one, as an openly gay presidential candidate being moderated by Anderson Cooper, an openly gay journalist, at a town hall specifically dedicated to issues within the LGBTQ community.\n",
      "Buttigieg’s coming out experience happened after he came back from deployment in Afghanistan and when he had already been elected mayor, he said. The 37-year-old Indiana native told his story of coming out at last month’s Democratic debate, marking the first time in American history that the public had heard a presidential candidate openly talk about their coming out experience.\n",
      "Cooper asked Buttigieg on Thursday what his earlier years were like when he first realizing he was gay.\n",

      "“What it was like was a civil war, because I knew I was different long before I was ready to say that I was gay and long before I was able to acknowledge that that was something that I didn’t have power over,” he responded.\n",
      "“I so admire people who are coming out at young ages but also recognize that there’s no right age or right way or right time to come out,” he said. “I think people are ready when they’re ready. And for me, I was well into my 20s before I was really ready to say even to myself that I was gay.”\n",
      "Buttigieg has previously talked about his “internal war,” and his journey toward accepting and being proud of his sexuality.\n",
      "The town hall occurred the same day Buttigieg unveiled his sweeping LGBTQ plan, which includes tackling HIV/AIDS, overturning the transgender military ban and securing the passage of the Equality Act, which amends the Civil Rights Act to specifically ban discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. \n",

      "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Friday unveiled a plan to pay for  “Medicare for All” that, at least on paper, fulfills the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate’s ambition of financing the program with no new taxes on the middle class.\n",
      "The plan, modeled on the bill from rival 2020 Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, envisions wiping away most existing insurance arrangements, private and public, in order to enroll nearly all Americans into a new government-run program that would cover all necessary medical expenses. It is designed both to cover those who don’t have insurance and to make health care more affordable for those who already do.\n",
      "The 9,000-word, 21-page plan is sprawling ― including everything from an expansion of Warren’s signature wealth tax to incentives for unionization to a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants ― and contains aggressive measures to contain the spiraling cost of health care almost certain to generate opposition from doctors, drugmakers and hospitals. It would be funded using heavy tax increases on the wealthy and a new per-employee tax meant to replace what business previously spent on health insurance.\n",
      "“Health care is a human right, and we need a system that reflects our values,” Warren writes in the introduction to her proposal. “That system is Medicare for All. Let’s be clear: America’s medical professionals are among the best in the world. Health care in America is world-class. Medicare for All isn’t about changing any of that. It’s about fixing what is broken – how we pay for that care.”\n",
      "A big question hanging over Medicare for All ― and, increasingly, Warren’s candidacy ― has been how to finance this massive new program, as the burden of paying for medical care shifts from businesses and individuals to the federal government.\n",
      "Warren, like Sanders and other Medicare for All advocates, has always said that all but the richest Americans would come out ahead financially, taking into account both the costs of the new system and the savings, compared to the old one. The proposal she released Friday explains exactly how she envisions that happening, and in so doing fills in some blanks that the Sanders bill had left.\n",
      "The decision to do so comes with no small amount of political risk: The more detailed a health care proposal, the bigger the target for the health care industry, outside experts, and her political rivals to poke holes in the plan and question its math.\n",
      "But Warren’s aides determined it was necessary, both to fulfill her campaign’s implicit promise to have detailed plan for seemingly every important policy, and to fend off increasingly feisty attacks from her more moderate rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination.\n",
      "The complicated plan, like any version of Medicare For All, is unlikely to become law, even if Democrats manage to win the presidency and both chambers of Congress in 2020, due to the unified opposition of Republicans and significant dissension within the Democratic ranks. But it could serve as an aggressive opening bid from a theoretical Warren administration on a proposal to expand health coverage and bring down the cost of care.\n",
      "Under Medicare for All, individuals wouldn’t have to pay premiums or out-of-pocket costs, and employers wouldn’t have to pay for their workers’ insurance, because the federal government would be paying for basically all medical bills.\n",
      "Aggressive Price Controls, Optimistic Assumptions\n",
      "A key question about such a transition has been exactly how much new money the federal government would need to pull off this dramatic shift and, then, where the government could find those dollars.\n",
      "On the cost of a new plan, estimates have varied. One of the more widely cited has come from the Urban Institute, a well-respected think tank whose researchers have estimated that moving to Medicare for All would require about $34 trillion in new spending over the next decade.\n",
      "Warren’s plan uses the Urban Institute estimate as a benchmark, but anticipates creating a program that would require a lot less new money: Medicare for All would need only $20 trillion in new money over the next decade, according to the Warren campaign.\n",
      "What accounts for the difference? A big chunk, about $6 trillion, would come from asking states to contribute the money they already spend on Medicaid and other health programs they run. The rest, roughly $8 trillion, would be through additional savings in health care relative to what the Urban Institute’s projection assumed.\n",
      "Some of these savings would be in the form of more aggressive price controls, like paying hospitals at 110% of Medicare rates rather than 115%, as Urban Institute used in its estimates. The Warren campaign is also assuming greater savings on prescription drugs, on the theory that her proposal (which would effectively break patents when drugmakers won’t accept lower reimbursements) would be more effective at reducing prices than the scheme the Urban Institute considered.\n",
      "Some of the additional savings reflect more optimistic assumptions about the benefits of simplicity; Warren’s campaign is assuming more than twice as much savings from reduced billing and overhead than Urban Institute researchers did. Some of the additional savings come from a belief that changing the way hospitals get paid (for example, by moving to “bundled payments” that give hospitals more incentive to be efficient) would generate big savings.\n",
      "Over the coming days and weeks, experts will get a closer look at these details and, inevitably, challenge assumptions that the Warren campaign has made ― or point out tradeoffs that aren’t so obvious at first blush.\n",
      "The optimistic projections of health new efficiencies are likely to meet a skeptical reception from other experts who will say they are not realistic, as either policy or politics. The calls to limit spending on doctors, hospitals and drugmakers are likely to spark a debate over whether such controls would undermine quality or timeliness of treatment, even as they eliminate financial barriers to care. The Warren campaign cites evidence backing all its claims, but that doesn’t mean the evidence is persuasive.\n",
      "“A big part of the financing for Warren’s plan comes from more aggressively containing health care costs,” Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost after reviewing the plan. “On the one hand, it would be quite disruptive to the health care system to constrain prices this much. On the other hand, every other developed country in the world provides universal coverage at a much lower cost than we spend now, which makes Warren’s plan look pretty reasonable and achievable. We would still be by far the most expensive health care system in the world, but somewhat less expensive than we are now.”\n",
      "New Taxes On Corporations And The Wealthy\n",
      "And how would Warren pay for that $20 trillion in new government spending? The bulk of the money ― about $8.8 trillion ― would come from a health insurance tax levied on businesses, essentially taking the money they now send to private companies for health care and redirecting it to the government. Warren aims to make the tax equal to roughly 98% of what companies pay now.\n",
      "Another $1.4 trillion would come from taxing the additional income Americans would earn instead of the deductions that come out of their paychecks.\n",
      "A collection of taxes on financial firms, wealthy Americans and corporations ― including the repeal of the Trump tax cuts, a financial transactions tax, a tax that would force American corporations to pay 35% on income they’ve earned anywhere in the world, and an increase of Warren’s proposed tax on fortunes over $1 billion to 5% ― would bring in an $6.8 trillion. Another $2.3 trillion would come from “improvements in tax enforcement,” with a final $1.2 trillion coming from additional revenue from immigration reform and from ending the overseas contingency operations fund.\n",
      "Each of the campaign’s tax proposals would generate significant opposition on their own. Immigration reform alone, for example, would amount to a titanic political fight.\n",
      "The Warren campaign has enlisted a number of boldface names in health care and economics to affirm the plan’s technical feasibility. Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and former Institute for Health Improvement president Donald Berwick vouched for the campaign’s cost estimates. Johnson, Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi and University of Michigan professor Betsey Stevenson vouched for the revenue proposals.\n",
      "Both Berwick and Stevenson served in the Obama administration ― Berwick as administrator of Medicare and Medicaid, Stevenson as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers.\n",
      "Battling with other Democrats\n",
      "Pressure on Warren to release such a plan increased after the October Democratic debate, when a number of candidates ― including former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar ― amplified existing criticisms of Warren’s lack of specifics on health care,― the top issue for voters in both the general election and the primary.\n",
      "The release of Warren’s plan on Friday was never likely to satiate her primary rivals, and it didn’t.\n",
      "“For months, Elizabeth Warren has refused to say if her health care plan would raise taxes on the middle class, and now we know why: because it does. Senator Warren would place a new tax of nearly $9 trillion that will fall on American workers,” Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement, referring to the plan’s tax on employers. “The mathematical gymnastics in this plan are all geared towards hiding a simple truth from voters: it’s impossible to pay for Medicare for All without middle class tax increases.”\n",
      "But Warren plans to use the heavy amount of details in her plan to begin knocking other candidates, especially Biden and Buttigieg, for the lack of detail in their own health plans, and for their plans’ failure to cover all Americans.\n",
      "“Every candidate who opposes my long-term goal of Medicare for All should explain why the ‘choice’ of private insurance plans is more important than being able to choose the doctor that’s best for you without worrying about whether they are in-network or not,” Warren writes in the Medium post outlining her plan. “Why it’s more important than being able to choose the right prescription drug for you without worrying about massive differences in copays. Why it’s more important than being able to choose to start a small business or choose the job you want without worrying about where your health care coverage will be coming from and how much it will cost.”\n",
      "Overcoming Union Opposition\n",
      "A significant part of Democratic opposition to Medicare-for-All has come from organized labor, whose members fear giving up often generous health benefits they have negotiated for. Warren’s plan aims to overcome that worry by promising a tax break to companies willing to take the savings from no longer having to pay for health care and turn them into additional wages or pensions.\n",
      "“That way, my plan helps unions that have bargained for good health care already, and creates a significant new incentive for unionization generally by making collective bargaining appealing for both workers and employers as a way of potentially reducing the employer’s Employer Medicare Contributions,” Warren writes.\n",
      "CORRECTION: This article previously misstated some specific figures of Warren’s plan as being in the billions of dollars, rather than trillions. Also, Donald Berwick, administrator of Medicare and Medicaid, was misidentified as acting administrator. \n",

      "The California Democrat said the revamped U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is a significant improvement over the original North American Free Trade Agreement, crediting Democratic negotiators for winning stronger provisions on enforcing the agreement.\n",
      "“There is no question of course that this trade agreement is much better than NAFTA,” Pelosi said in announcing the agreement, saying the pact is “infinitely better than what was initially proposed by the administration.”\n",

      "Vice President Mike Pence, a foot soldier in the administration’s campaign to sell the accord, said Pelosi had “acquiesced” in slating the pact for a vote this year.\n",
      "“The USMCA will create even more jobs for the hardworking families who are the backbone of our economy – the farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and small business owners,” Pence said in a statement.\n",
      "Pelosi is the key congressional force behind the accord, which updates the 25-year-old NAFTA accord that many Democrats — especially from manufacturing areas hit hard by trade-related job losses — have long lambasted.\n",
      "Pelosi has negotiated with the administration extensively to win stronger enforcement provisions. Her efforts have appeared to build support among Democrats.\n",
      "“There are those who I read about in one place or another that say, ‘why would you give President Trump a victory?’” Pelosi said Monday night at a Wall Street Journal event for corporate executives. “Well, why wouldn’t we? This is the right thing to do for our trade situation, for our workers.”\n",
      "NAFTA eliminated most tariffs and other trade barriers involving the United States, Mexico and Canada. Critics, including Trump, labor unions and many Democratic lawmakers, branded the pact a job killer for the United States because it encouraged factories to move south of the border, capitalize on low-wage Mexican workers and ship products back to the U.S. duty free.\n",
      "Weeks of back-and-forth, closely monitored by Democratic labor allies such as the AFL-CIO, have brought the two sides together. Pelosi is a longtime free trade advocate and supported the original NAFTA in 1994. Trump has accused Pelosi of being incapable of passing the agreement because she is too wrapped up in impeachment.\n",
      "The original NAFTA badly divided Democrats but the new pact is more protectionist and labor-friendly, and Pelosi is confident it won’t divide the party, though some liberal activists took to social media to carp at the agreement.\n",
      "“There is no denying that the trade rules in America will now be fairer because of our hard work and perseverance. Working people have created a new standard for future trade negotiations,“said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka. “President Trump may have opened this deal. But working people closed it.”\n",
      "Business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce also chimed in to support the long-delayed agreement.\n",
      "“We are optimistic this development will open the door to final approval of USMCA on a bipartisan basis by the end of the year, which will especially benefit American farmers, manufacturers, and small businesses,” Thomas Donohue, CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.\n",
      "“This agreement has been the result of painstaking bipartisan negotiations over the past year, and would not have been possible if not for the willingness of President Trump to work patiently with Democrats to get something done that he knew was in the best interests of American workers, farmers and manufacturers,” said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, a former U.S. trade representative.\n",
      "Republicans leaders and lawmakers have agitated for months for the accord but Pelosi has painstakingly worked to bring labor on board. Democrats see the pact as significantly better than NAFTA and Trumka’s endorsement is likely to add to a strong vote by Democrats that have proven skeptical of trade agreements.\n",
      "“I think the vote’s going to be pretty good,” said No. 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer, D-Md., a veteran party whip. “There’s a general agreement — not total agreement, it’s not unanimity — that USMCA is better. It’s an improvement. And to the extent that Trumka and labor comes out and says that this is an improvement, I think that that will be unifying.”\n",
      "The pact contains provisions designed to nudge manufacturing back to the United States. For example, it requires that 40% to 45% of cars eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least $16 an hour — that is, in the United States and Canada and not in Mexico.\n",
      "The trade pact picked up some momentum after Mexico in April passed a labor-law overhaul required by USMCA. The reforms are meant to make it easier for Mexican workers to form independent unions and bargain for better pay and working conditions, narrowing the gap with the United States.\n",
      "The end-stage talks focused on provisions to improve the enforcement of the accord. \n",

      "Drafts of the book outline obtained by The New York Times describe Trump telling Bolton in August that he wanted to continue freezing nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military assistance to Ukraine until officials there agreed to help investigate his political rival.\n",

      "A key part of Trump’s defense in the impeachment process has been that his decision to withhold the aid was completely separate from his request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Tying the two together would indicate that Trump attempted a quid pro quo with a foreign government in order to sway the 2020 presidential election ― which Democrats have said was the case since the impeachment inquiry began.\n",
      "According to the Times, Bolton alleged that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo privately admitted there was no basis to Rudy Giuliani’s claims that ousted U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was corrupt, and he believed Trump’s personal attorney was acting on behalf of other clients.\n",
      "Bolton also wrote that acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was around for at least one phone call during which Trump and Giuliani discussed Yovanovitch, according to the Times.\n",
      "Bolton also reportedly said he raised his concerns about Giuliani’s shadow diplomacy with Attorney General William Barr after Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Bolton alleged that he was the one who informed Barr that the president mentioned him on the call, according to the Times. A spokesperson for Barr told the publication he denied that allegation.\n",
      "Bolton’s account of Trump’s alleged remarks were included in the former national security adviser’s unpublished manuscript, which he has been circulating to close associates. The book, according to the Times, represents what Bolton might say in a testimony if the Senate calls him as a witness in Trump’s impeachment trial.\n",

      "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg excoriated her conservative colleagues over their decision to deny Wisconsin Democrats’ request to extend the deadline for absentee voting in the state’s election on Tuesday, despite concerns over the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "In a 5-4 vote on Monday, the Supreme Court’s conservative bloc refused to extend the absentee voting deadline by six days, saying instead all mail-in ballots must be postmarked by Tuesday and received by April 13. Democrats had pleaded with the courts to give more leeway to voters as COVID-19 wreaks havoc around the nation, infecting more than 366,000 people and killing more than 10,000. The nation’s top public health officials have urged Americans to practice social distancing and to remain at home as much as possible, directives that run counter to entering a crowded polling place.\n",
      "Ginsburg, who was joined in her dissent by the three other liberal Justices, said her conservative colleagues’ decision to see the election proceed as planned would effectively strip many Wisconsinites of their right to vote “through no fault of their own.”\n",
      "“The question here is whether tens of thousands of Wisconsin citizens can vote safely in the midst of a pandemic,” Ginsburg wrote on Monday. “With the majority’s stay in place, that will not be possible. Either they will have to brave the polls, endangering their own and others’ safety. Or they will lose their right to vote, through no fault of their own.”\n",
      "She continued: “That is a matter of utmost importance — to the constitutional rights of Wisconsin’s citizens, the integrity of the State’s election process, and in this most extraordinary time, the health of the Nation.”\n",
      "The Wisconsin Election Commission reported Monday that 43% of the absentee ballots already requested had not yet been returned.\n",
      "“While I do not doubt the good faith of my colleagues, the Court’s order, I fear, will result in massive disenfranchisement,” Ginsburg wrote. “A voter cannot deliver for postmarking a ballot she has not received. Yet tens of thousands of voters who timely requested ballots are unlikely to receive them by April 7, the Court’s postmark deadline.”\n",
      "At the same time, Wisconsin’s highest court blocked another effort by Gov. Tony Evers (D) to postpone all in-person voting until June in a 4-2 decision (both liberal justices dissented). The move came just 14 hours before polls were set to open for the state’s primary election.\n",
      "Ben Wikler, the head of Wisconsin’s Democratic Party, said the Court’s decision would be “etched in history” and potentially result in many deaths.\n",
      "“The Supreme Court of the United States legislated from the bench today, following Trump team’s orders and writing a new election law to disenfranchise untold thousands of Wisconsin voters and consign an unknown number of Wisconsinites to their deaths,” he said in a statement.\n",

      "Four top federal regulators ― including two Democrats ― urged the Federal Reserve last month to weaken a key post-crisis rule limiting risk-taking at the nation’s six largest banks. If successful, the bipartisan effort would boost short-term bank profits but render the financial system vulnerable to another crash.\n",
      "At issue is the supplementary leverage rule, which was adopted in the aftermath of the 2008 collapse as a last line of defense against financial excess. While most banking rules involve a dizzying array of technical definitions, exceptions and complications to account for different risks, the leverage rule was designed to be a simple, blunt instrument.\n",
      "At the most basic operational level, banks get into trouble when they rely too heavily on borrowed money to “leverage” their own capital. The more borrowed money banks use, the bigger their profits during a boom and the larger their losses in an unforeseen downturn. Regulators impose leverage requirements in order to reduce the amount of borrowed money banks can put into play.\n",
      "But four out of five top officials at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission want the Fed to lower leverage requirements by changing the way the officials treat derivatives ― complex financial instruments that banks buy and sell on behalf of other institutional clients. Two of the four regulators, Rostin Behnam and Dan Berkovitz, were handpicked by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to fill the agency’s dedicated slots for Democrats. The fifth commissioner, Dawn Stump, recused herself from commenting on the rule.\n",
      "In the years since the banking crash, even Republicans have been reluctant to openly call for looser regulations on the largest banks. Wall Street’s advocates in Washington typically point to the assistance that deregulation will provide to small banks, or blame federal regulators for problems instead of the banks they oversee.\n",
      "But that posture may be changing. Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin endorsed a plan to lower leverage requirements for big banks in 2017. At a congressional hearing last week, Reps. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) and Roger Williams (R-Texas) defended the scandal-plagued banking behemoth Wells Fargo, deriding its critics as advocates of “socialist banking” and “socialism.” Last month, five Republican Senators led by Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) wrote to the Government Accountability Office, seeking to build a case for repealing regulatory guidance on the largest banks through the Congressional Review Act.\n",
      "And at least some Democrats appear to be joining the deregulation push. Derivatives typically function as a sort of bet on economic activity ― a gamble that the price of a financial asset will move up or down. When banks trade derivatives for hedge funds or other investors, they are required to charge a small up-front fee called “margin,” which the bank can use to help cushion any losses should their clients be unable to pay up. Berkovitz, Behnam and Republican Commissioners Christopher Giancarlo and Brian Quintenz argue that this margin should be excluded from leverage calculations, increasing the amount of borrowed money banks can put into play under existing leverage requirements.\n",
      "Including margin, the bipartisan team of regulators argued, discourages banks from trading derivatives through central clearinghouses, which is a safer and more transparent way to trade. Central clearinghouses guarantee the ability of each bank to make good on their bets, helping prevent a default from a bank from cascading through the financial system. The CFTC Commissioners argued that the current rule is “working counterproductively” and producing “an inflated measure” of a bank’s overall “exposure” to trouble.\n",
      "Lobbyists for big banks have been making this argument for years, but data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency tells a different story. In recent years, banks have increased the proportion of derivatives they send through a central clearinghouse.\n",
      "Financial reform advocates, meanwhile, note that other CFTC rules flatly require risky types of derivatives to go through a clearinghouse, while separate requirements on bank capital can be tailored to encourage or discourage particular types of trading.\n",
      "“The idea that lowering their leverage requirements will make the system safer ― that’s a really incredible thing for federal regulators to say,” said Gregg Gelzinis, a policy analyst at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank. “Carving up the leverage ratio and lowering the equity buffers at Wall Street banks will only increase the likelihood of another crash.”\n",
      "The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the Securities and Exchange Commission have final say over leverage requirements, and are currently in the process of rewriting the rules. Both the Fed and the SEC are stacked with Trump appointees friendly to big banks, but support within the agencies is not uniform. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Randall Quarles approved of reducing leverage requirements last year, while Lael Brainard, an Obama appointee, did not. Public support from two Democratic regulators at the CFTC changes the dynamic in Washington, helping insulate the Fed’s deregulation advocates from criticism.\n",
      "But at least some Democrats in Congress are crying foul. Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) was a bank regulation scholar for years before she ran for Congress last year, and has been a scourge of financial heavyweights from her new post on the House Financial Services Committee. In a statement provided to HuffPost, Porter excoriated the plan to weaken leverage rules as “another example of Trump regulators listening to Wall Street’s wish list.”\n",
      "“Between this, the banking deregulation bill passed last year, and other changes proposed by the Fed and OCC, we can expect Too Big to Fail banks to get riskier and have less of a cushion to guard taxpayers from bailouts,” Porter said. \n",

      "Voting advocates raised concern Monday that Florida lawmakers are trying to water down a constitutional amendment passed last year that allows people with felony convictions to vote once they complete their sentences.\n",
      "The measure went into effect in January. Prior to that, Florida was one of four states in the country that permanently banned former felons from voting, a policy rooted in the Jim Crow South. Last November, Florida voters overwhelmingly rejected that practice and approved voting rights restoration. The reform is estimated to affect up to 1.4 million people and earned the state wide praise.\n",
      "Advocates say the measure is “self executing,” but lawmakers say they need to pass legislation to implement it and clarify some ambiguities. Voters approved an amendment that specifically says people convicted of “murder” and “felony sexual offenses” will remain permanently barred from voting. A bill in the Florida House would exclude people convicted of first- and second-degree murder as well as a range of felony sexual offenses from voting. The House’s criminal justice subcommittee advanced the bill Tuesday morning.\n",
      "The bill would also not let people with felonies vote until they repay “any cost of supervision” as well as any financial obligations related to their conviction. Advocates who pushed for the amendment strongly oppose such a provision, saying that it conditions one’s ability to vote on how much money they have.\n",
      "This is exactly what we were worried about from the beginning — legislative attempts to undermine the will of the people.\n",
      "Kirk Bailey, political director, ACLU of Florida\n",
      "The state should only require people to repay fines and fees that were part of their original sentence before restoring their rights, Neil Volz, the political director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, said during a hearing earlier this year.\n",
      "The bill in the House is an “affront” to the voters who approved the constitutional amendment, according to Kirk Bailey, the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, which supported the measure.\n",
      "“This is exactly what we were worried about from the beginning — legislative attempts to undermine the will of the people who voted for second chances and to rid Florida of the last vestiges of its Jim Crow era past,” Bailey said in a statement. ”This bill will broaden the narrow exclusions for murder and sexual felony offense in the amendment, and broaden what was contemplated by completion of one’s sentence to include all sorts of court fees and supervision costs unrelated to one’s sentence.”\n",
      "Requiring repayment of fines and fees could affect up to 540,000 people, according to a 2018 estimate by Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, and Marc Mauer, the executive director of the Sentencing Project.\n",
      "Desmond Meade, the executive director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the main group behind the bill, sent an email to supporters on Monday afternoon saying the constitutional amendment was “under attack.”\n",
      "State Rep. James Grant (R), the chairman of Florida’s House Criminal Justice Subcommittee, did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment. He told the Orlando Sentinel that the constitutional amendment was unclear.\n",
      "“When the Constitution says ‘felony sex offenses’ and that means nothing legally, the best I can do is propose a list of felonies that are sexual,” he said. “The reality is I’m going to do my best effort to maintain what I believe the rule of law now requires in a super-ambiguous constitutional amendment.”\n",
      "Grant said during testimony Tuesday that advocates indicated requiring payment of fines and fees would be acceptable when they asked the Florida Supreme Court to approve the measure for the ballot.\n",

      "WASHINGTON ― With Democrats back in control, the House passed the most significant piece of gun control legislation in more than two decades Wednesday.\n",
      "By a vote of 240-190, the House approved a bill that would require background checks on all gun sales in the United States. Currently, only licensed firearm dealers have to perform background checks, and unlicensed dealers ― such as those at gun shows ― can sell a gun without going through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).\n",
      "Eight Republicans joined all but two Democrats in support of the bill, and the measure will now go to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain future. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has not committed to bringing the bill up for a vote, and it likely doesn’t have the 60 senators it needs to make it to a final vote.\n",
      "But the bill passing the House Wednesday marks a significant turn in its own right. The last gun control measure to pass the House was in 1994, the sweeping Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act that banned a number of semi-automatic weapons. And though Democrats have repeatedly tried to pass other gun control measures when Republicans controlled the House ― Democrats actually first introduced the legislation as a response to an attack on former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) ― they were unable to get up-or-down votes on a bill in recent years.\n",
      "But support in Congress has been mounting for stricter gun laws. While the new Democratic majority in the House made passage of the background checks bill possible, the eight Republicans who supported the bill Wednesday show how the gun issue isn’t falling as neatly along partisan lines.\n",
      "Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) actually co-sponsored the background checks bill with Democrat Mike Thompson of California, and public support for universal background checks has been growing with each mass shooting.

Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) introduced Lynne Patton, who was appointed by Trump to be the New York–New Jersey regional administrator for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. She has no prior experience in the field and was previously an event planner who helped plan Eric Trump’s wedding.\n",
      "“I asked Lynne to come today in her personal capacity to actually shed some light,” Meadows said as she stood behind him. “You made some very demeaning comments about the president that Ms. Patton doesn’t agree with. In fact, it has to do with your claim of racism. She says as a daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, that there is no way that she would work for an individual who was a racist.”\n",

As noted by the Southern District of New York, Cohen’s wide array of crimes were ‘marked by a pattern of deception that permeated his professional life’ and his ‘instinct to blame others is strong.’ Prosecutors said his actions were to ensure that he would ‘profit personally, build his own power, and enhance his level of influence.’ This is the same Michael Cohen who has admitted that he lied to Congress previously.

      "The search warrant, while heavily redacted, offered new details about the federal inquiry of Cohen’s business dealings and the FBI raids of his Manhattan home and office.\n",

      "Lanny Davis, an attorney for Cohen, said the release of the search warrant “furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump organization to law enforcement and Congress.”\n",
      "The FBI raided Cohen’s Manhattan home and office last April and seized more than 4 million electronic and paper files. The searches marked the first public sign of a criminal investigation that has threatened Trump’s presidency and netted Cohen a three-year prison sentence for tax evasion and campaign-finance violations.\n",

      "Tuesday’s release of the search warrant came nearly six weeks after U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III partially granted a request by several media organizations, including The Associated Press, that the search warrant be made public due to the high public interest in the case.\n",
      "The judge acknowledged prosecutors’ concerns that a wholesale release of the document “would jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties,” a ruling that revealed prosecutors are still investigating Cohen’s illegal payments to two women to stay silent about alleged affairs with Trump.\n",
      "The judge ordered prosecutors to redact Cohen’s personal information and details in the warrant that refer to ongoing investigations and several third-parties who have cooperated with the inquiry. But he authorized the release of details in the warrant that relate to Cohen’s tax evasion and false statements to financial institutions charges, along with Cohen’s conduct that did not result in criminal charges.\n",

      "A onetime employee of former billionaire hedge fund manager and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein has gone public with new accusations after signing an affidavit as part of a lawsuit against Epstein’s longtime friend Alan Dershowitz.\n",
      "Maria Farmer was 26 when she said she was assaulted by Epstein in 2006 while working for him keeping records of the people who visited his New York mansion, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday by another accuser. Epstein helped operate an international sex ring from Florida and overseas, and was convicted in 2007 of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution. He served only a year of jail time, and a judge ruled in February that prosecutors broke federal law when signing a plea agreement with Epstein.\n",
      "During her time working for Epstein, Farmer “witnessed a number of school age girls coming to the house, some of the young girls would be wearing their school uniforms” before she saw them going upstairs, according to the lawsuit.\n",
      "Farmer’s testimony is part of a defamation lawsuit against Harvard Law professor and Fox News contributor Alan Dershowitz, a longtime friend of Epstein. He is accused of having known about and taking part in the sexual exploitation of minors. The lawsuit was filed by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s victims, the Miami Herald reported.\n",
      "According to Farmer’s affidavit, “Dershowitz was very comfortable at the home and would come in and walk upstairs. On a number of occasions I witnessed Dershowitz at the NY mansion going upstairs at the same time there were young girls under the age of 18 who were present upstairs in the house.”\n",
      "In response to allegations that he took part in Epstein’s sexual exploitation, Dershowitz called himself a victim, the Miami Herald reported in December.\n",
      "“I am the victim. [Attorney] David Boies and these women are the perpetrators,’’ Dershowitz said. “They have willfully and deliberately concocted stories in order to make money — millions and millions of dollars. And I will not rest until the entire story comes out.”\n",

      "In a more normal time, if a woman alleged the man who would become the U.S. president kissed her without consent, it might be a major national story meriting weeks of intense news coverage.\n",
      "But the current president is Donald Trump, who has now been accused of sexual misconduct and harassment by more than twenty women, who was caught on tape boasting about groping, and who was elected to office anyway. So when Alva Johnson, a former Trump campaign staffer, revealed last month that Trump had forcibly kissed her prior to his election, her name was added to the long list, and the news cycle mostly moved on.\n",
      "Other women who have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct and misbehavior are disappointed he has faced no repercussions, several told HuffPost. They feel as if many people simply don’t care. They also recognize there are so many accusations of wrongdoing by Trump at this point, it’s hard to keep track. But they support Johnson — and would still encourage other possible victims to come forward.\n",
      "Rachel Crooks was not surprised to see Johnson’s claim because “we’ve seen this type of behavior from [Trump] over decades,” she told HuffPost in an email. She has alleged Trump forcibly kissed her without her consent more than ten years ago, when she was 22.\n",
      "“I was also sad because we’ve let Alva Johnson down,” she added. “If our society would’ve held Trump accountable for his actions, she may not have had to endure this.”\n",
      "Johnson claims in her lawsuit, filed last month against Trump in federal court, that in August of 2016 when she was working as a staffer for Trump’s campaign, he forcibly kissed her on the mouth. She tried to avoid the kiss by turning her head away, and the incident left her confused and humiliated. Johnson, who is black, also says she experienced race and gender discrimination and was underpaid compared to white and male employees.\n",
      "I was also sad because we’ve let Alva Johnson down. If our society would’ve held Trump accountable for his actions, she may not have had to endure this.\n",
      "Rachel Crooks, a woman who said Trump kissed her without consent\n",
      "Less than two months after Trump allegedly kissed Johnson without consent, The Washington Post published the Access Hollywood tape, where Trump bragged that he could grab women “by the pussy.” Many women subsequently went public about their own interactions with Trump. Johnson was horrified by the tape, according to her lawsuit, because the conduct Trump boasted of was so similar to what she had experienced. She quit his campaign shortly afterward, the lawsuit says.\n",
      "“It seems right now we’re going backward,” Johnson told Teen Vogue in an interview published this month. “This wasn’t appropriate for a long time. Now the most powerful man in the world is making fun of people who are coming forward [about sexual abuse], calling them liars even though their stories are so consistent.”\n",
      "White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called Johnson’s accusation “absurd on its face.” Trump has repeatedly denied allegations of sexual misconduct against him. “You are a disgusting human being,” he told a New York Times reporter who questioned him about some of the women’s claims. He dismissed his comments in the Access Hollywood tape as “locker-room banter.” He also in 2016 threatened to sue his accusers. That never happened.\n",
      "It was only a matter of time before someone from Trump’s campaign or administration had a similar experience to what other women have been speaking about for years now, said Samantha Holvey, a former Miss North Carolina USA.\n",
      "Holvey said that when she met Trump at an event prior to the Miss USA pageant in 2006, he eyed her like a “piece of meat.” She had “never felt so objectified and dirty,” she said. A few days later, she said, she was in her robe in the hair and makeup area, and he walked in, in a way that felt to her like he “wanted to exert his dominance and power.” (Trump has bragged about getting away with going backstage when contestants were getting dressed, though his campaign generally denied claims that he did so.)\n",
      "“He’s been sexually assaulting and harassing women for decades with no repercussions so why would he stop now?” Holvey told HuffPost in an email.\n",
      "Although some women have accused Trump of behavior that fits the definition of groping, many of the reported incidents occurred a long time ago, and the statutes of limitations have expired. Johnson hopes to get justice, not just for herself, but all the victims, her attorney, Hassan Zavareei, told HuffPost a phone interview.\n",
      "He’s been sexually assaulting and harassing women for decades with no repercussions so why would he stop now?\n",
      "Samantha Holvey, a former Miss North Carolina USA\n",
      "Most of her friends and family, even strangers on the street, have been encouraging to Johnson, Zavareei said. But “Trump’s behavior and bad actions have become so normalized, that it barely registers on the public consciousness,” he added.\n",
      "Part of the reason Johnson wanted to come forward, he added, was to say, “it’s not normal, it’s not okay.” He raised the question of how the public might react if the accused were another president.\n",
      "The living former president whose alleged conduct perhaps comes closest is Bill Clinton, who was repeatedly accused of sexual misconduct and whose affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky has drawn fresh scrutiny over the unequal power dynamics. In Clinton’s case, he denied the misconduct allegations, however, the Republican-led House of Representatives moved to impeach him.\n",
      "The climate is different now. The Me Too movement has ousted powerful men from their jobs and led to legal repercussions in some cases: Ex-film mogul Harvey Weinstein could face life in prison if convicted of sex offenses; Bill Cosby has already been convicted of aggravated indecent assault. Women who’ve accused Trump of sexual misconduct would also like to see him face consequences — but they aren’t optimistic.\n",
      "“It would be nice to see something happen to him — it would be nice that he doesn’t get re-elected,” said Kristin Anderson, who claims Trump reached under her skirt and groped her at a nightclub in the early 1990s. The fact that he got elected the first time, despite the allegations against him, shows some people, “really don’t care about other people’s abuse. If it were them, they would care,” she told HuffPost in a phone interview.\n",
      "She’d like to see, at a minimum, Trump apologize and change his ways, she said. But based on what Johnson says happened to her, it looks like “he’s still up to it,” she added.\n",
      "The women HuffPost spoke with said they would still encourage women to come forward with their experiences.\n",
      "“The more people who do it, the more it shows — it should at least — what kind of character he is,” said another woman who has publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct but asked not to be named because she fears the consequences for her family if she continues to speak out.\n",
      "For women who speak out, “whether he’s held accountable or not, you’ve released it,” Anderson said, noting she feels that it’s women speaking up for themselves that’s the most important part. “It’s very healing, and that’s what counts.” \n",

      "President Donald Trump on Tuesday vetoed a resolution to end U.S. support of Saudi Arabia’s military campaign in Yemen, which has been blamed for tens of thousands of deaths in the region.\n",
      "“This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,” Trump said in a statement accompanying his veto.\n",
      "The Senate passed the resolution by a slim majority in March, and the House did the same earlier this month. It was a rare use of the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which gives Congress the power to remove military forces from a conflict for which there’s been no formal declaration of war.\n",
      "The measure was passed by a bipartisan group of senators, including seven Republican senators who broke ranks with their party leaders. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had urged lawmakers to reject the resolution at the time, saying it was “inappropriate and counterproductive.”\n",
      "The veto was Trump’s second of his administration. He issued his first last month, blocking Congress’ attempt to end a “national emergency” declaration meant to obtain funds to build a wall along the southern border.\n",
      "The move on Tuesday drew a quick backlash of rebukes, including from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has long been critical of the Yemeni conflict.\n",
      "“I am disappointed, but not surprised, that Trump has rejected the bi-partisan resolution to end U.S. involvement in the horrific war in Yemen,” Sanders, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, said in a statement. “The people of Yemen desperately need humanitarian help, not more bombs.”\n",
      "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) lambasted the president, saying he had “cynically chosen to contravene a bipartisan, bicameral vote of the Congress.”\n",

      "Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who sits on the chamber’s Foreign Relations Committee, also condemned the move as a “huge mistake.”\n",
      "“The civil war in Yemen is a humanitarian crisis, and we have no business still being a part of it,” he said in a statement. “I’ve been calling on the United States to get out of the civil war in Yemen for the last four years, and this veto won’t stop me.”\n",
      "Trump’s apparent fondness for Saudi Arabia has drawn the ire of many lawmakers, particularly after last year’s killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post. American intelligence agencies determined that the order to murder Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul came directly from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. But the president has refused to condemn the crown prince for his role, instead saying that he stood by the Saudis.\n",
      "“It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event — maybe he did and maybe he didn’t,” Trump said in November. “In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”\n",
      "America supplies billions in arms sales to Riyadh, and the U.S. military has helped train the Saudi air force while advising the country on its war effort, according to a December report in The New York Times. In Washington, lawmakers have grown increasingly concerned about the deaths of civilians during airstrikes in Yemen, a toll that has continued to rise.\n",
      "The war in Yemen has caused the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. The United Nations estimated in February that 24 million people ― about 80% of Yemen’s population ― were in need of assistance and that hundreds of thousands were at risk of starvation due to a famine.\n",
      "“We remain keenly aware that a sustainable peace ... would be the most effective remedy for the humanitarian crisis in Yemen,” Mark Lowcock, the U.N. humanitarian chief, said this week. “Without peace, we will simply go on treating the symptoms of this crisis, instead of addressing the cause. Let me summarize: Violence has again increased. The relief operation is running out of money. Barring changes, the end is nigh.”\n",

      "News that former national security adviser Susan Rice is apparently among a handful of women under consideration to be Joe Biden’s running mate has Republicans salivating — especially GOP foreign policy hawks in the Senate.\n",
      "“It’d be a good move for Republicans,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Wednesday when asked about the possibility Biden settles on Rice as his vice presidential pick.\n",
      "“I don’t think she’ll wear well over time,” he chuckled of the former aide to President Barack Obama.\n",
      "Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said Tuesday he’ll be making the long-anticipated announcement next week. He has vowed to select a woman — someone, he said, who is “simpatico with me, both in terms of personality as well as substance” but who has “strengths and capacities I don’t.”\n",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a prominent progressive voice on foreign policy, said all the purported candidates on Biden’s shortlist, including Rice, would make a “great” vice president. “Republicans have never let the facts get in the way of a good narrative,” he said in defense of Rice.\n",
      "Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois are also among those reportedly on Biden’s shortlist. Others floated for the job include Reps. Val Demings of Florida and Karen Bass of California.\n",
      "It’s not clear how seriously one should take reports that Rice is being considered for the job. Multiple candidates usually get floated to the press, and those who are seriously in the running often don’t talk about it. Moreover, Rice has no experience in elected office, and her expertise in foreign policy overlaps an area in which Biden is already well versed.\n",
      "But the recent speculation surrounding Rice apparently has the GOP tickled, nevertheless. Many Republican lawmakers view her involvement in Obama-era controversies, such as the 2012 terrorist attacks on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, as an opportunity to go after Biden’s eight-year record as vice president and his decades-long record on foreign policy in the Senate, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n",
      "“Susan Rice was the ‘Typhoid Mary’ of the Obama-era foreign policy, and Joe Biden and his Secretary of Defense Bob Gates have been wrong about every foreign policy decision of the last 40 years,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who might be the biggest foreign policy hawk in the upper chamber, put it recently. Gates was secretary of defense under George W. Bush and then Obama. He earlier served as CIA director.\n",
      "Asked about Rice as Biden’s possible veep on Wednesday, Cotton tilted his head back and laughed.\n",
      "Rice’s handling of the aftermath of the Benghazi attacks is apparently a factor in her consideration as Biden’s running mate. According to The New York Times, “people close to Mr. Biden... fear that choosing her would force the campaign to spend precious days relitigating her role” in responding to the attacks. As then-ambassador to the United Nations, Rice was criticized for delivering talking points she was given by the administration that blamed the attacks on an internet video.\n",
      "Rice defended her role in responding to the consulate attacks on Wednesday, however, saying that the many congressional probes Republicans set up to look into the matter cleared her of wrongdoing.\n",
      "“Not one of them found that I had deliberately misled the American people, but I don’t doubt that the Republicans will use this, and they’ll attack whoever is Joe Biden’s choice to be his vice president. But let’s be honest about what this is. This is dishonest, and it’s a distraction,” Rice said in an interview with ABC’s “The View.”\n",
      "Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), another critic of the Obama administration’s foreign policy, suggested another line of attack against Rice if she becomes Biden’s running mate: her role in “unmasking” identities of Americans connected with President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and transition team who were mentioned in foreign surveillance intelligence reports. Some of those reports involved conversations with suspected Russian intelligence sources.\n",
      "Paul suggested without evidence that Rice’s actions were political in nature ― namely that she was seeking to target and damage Trump before he took office. Rice, however, says she was simply doing her job as the country’s national security adviser.\n",
      "“If I were vetting her, I would see how much involvement she had in political purposes,” the Kentucky senator said Wednesday, questioning “whether or not she abused her authority for unmasking.”\n",
      "Rice has ratcheted up her attacks against Trump and his policies as chatter about her future has grown in recent days. She has been particularly vocal about the president’s handling of intelligence indicating that Russian officials had paid bounties to Taliban-linked militants in exchange for the deaths of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The former national security adviser said Trump “knew and has chosen not to act” on the information.\n",
      "Trump confirmed to Axios on Tuesday that he had never brought the issue up with Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite speaking to him a half dozen times since the reports first surfaced.\n",
      "Rice has also been active on Trump’s favorite social media platform. When the president said he was backing out of throwing the opening pitch at an upcoming Yankees baseball game, she tweeted a photo of herself throwing the first pitch at a Nationals game in 2013.\n",
      "“What’s the matter, Mr. President? Can’t get it up and over the plate?” she wrote.\n",

      "Oregon Gov. Kate Brown announced Wednesday that the federal officers brought in to quell anti-racism protests in Portland will leave the city beginning Thursday after weeks of violent clashes with demonstrators.\n",
      "“These federal officers have acted as an occupying force, refused accountability, and brought violence and strife to our community,” Brown said in a statement.\n",
      "The governor said a “phased” withdrawal agreement came out of talks with Vice President Mike Pence and other officials this week.\n",
      "Crowds advocating against racism and police brutality have been showing up daily around a federal courthouse building in Portland since the death of George Floyd, the Black Minnesota man who was killed by a white police officer in late May. Department of Homeland Security acting secretary Chad Wolf has repeatedly said the federal officers were needed to protect federal property from damage.\n",
      "Before they go, the federal officers “will also clean up the Courthouse, removing the graffiti,” Brown said.\n",
      "In exchange, Oregon State Police will ramp up security for the exterior of the building, while a small number of federal officers will patrol the interior, as they typically do year-round.\n",
      "Local officials have been outspoken about their opposition to the federal officers’ presence, arguing that they had made the situation worse. Since the beginning, protesters opposed the use of force and tear gas by local police.\n",
      "“We need to recognize that the protests in Portland are not solely about the federal presence,” Brown said.\n",
      "“If slavery is America’s original sin, then anti-Blackness is Oregon’s,” she said in the conclusion of her statement. “Even before it was recognized as a state, Oregon prevented African Americans from settling here and owning property. For far too long, Oregon’s constitution ingrained discrimination into state law.”\n",
      "The federal officers’ use of tear gas and dangerous projectiles injured multiple protesters, including one who was standing opposite a row of officers holding a speaker above his head earlier this month. One then shot him in the head with an impact munition, fracturing his skull. The officers also sparked outrage when video emerged showing groups of them patrolling streets in unmarked vans, failing to identify themselves as they detained protesters and drove away.\n",
      "In recent days, a group of mothers in yellow T-shirts began gathering to attempt to protect the younger protesters, earning the nickname “wall of moms.” Another group, “leaf blower dads,” began showing up with cordless leaf blowers, which proved to be very effective at blocking tear gas and sending it back in the direction of the federal officers.\n",
      "Last week, video of a Navy veteran enduring a beating from the officers went viral; the man, 53-year-old Christopher David, said he was inspired to join the protests after seeing officers in unmarked vehicles make arrests. He was also pepper sprayed in the face.\n",
      "Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler made headlines on July 23 for being in a crowd of demonstrators that was tear-gassed by federal agents. The mayor, who is also the city’s police commissioner, has been intensely criticized by protesters for not doing more to rein in local police.\n",

      "Vice President Mike Pence held a quiet meeting on Tuesday with a group called America’s Frontline Doctors to discuss the use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as an unproven treatment for COVID-19. The meeting came as video of a Monday press conference held by the group was going mega-viral online, racking up tens of millions of views and leading to a widespread effort by social media companies to remove the video and penalize some people who shared it, including one of the president’s sons.\n",
      "Pence’s office did not publicize the meeting nor respond to requests for comment, but several members of the group tweeted Tuesday evening that the meeting had just occurred. “Just finished a great meeting with Vice President Mike Pence and his Chief of Staff,” wrote James Todaro, a member of the group who trained as an ophthalmologist. “We are doing everything to restore the power of medicine back to doctors. Doctors everywhere should be able to prescribe Hydroxychloroquine without repercussions or obstruction.”\n",
      "Todaro, who also presents himself as a cryptocurrency entrepreneur, co-authored a widely circulated Google Docs file proclaiming the benefits of hydroxychloroquine in March. It claimed to be affiliated with Stanford Medical University and several other institutions, but HuffPost reported in March that wasn’t true. Google removed the document for violating its terms of service, but not before it gained the attention of Fox News and other right-wing media outlets, which began promoting the document. Trump advocated for the drug shortly after.\n",
      "The Monday press conference by America’s Frontline Doctors, whose website went live only days ago and is now offline as of Wednesday, contained numerous pieces of potentially harmful misinformation, including falsely claiming a “cure” for COVID-19 and telling people they don’t need masks.\n",

      "Vice President Mike Pence met with the group behind a viral video touting the use of hydroxychloroquine to \"cure\" COVID-19.\n",
      "Simone Gold, who founded the group, is a frequent guest on Fox News and has spoken at anti-lockdown rallies around the country. Gold tweeted that she and other members had met with Pence to advocate for hydroxychloroquine and discuss “censorship of doctors.” (Gold did not respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.)\n",
      "Despite the lack of evidence for the medical claims in the video and highly questionable expertise of some of the group’s members, the White House appears to be lending it legitimacy by inviting the group to meet with Pence. In addition to Pence meeting with the group this week, Trump also praised the video in a Tuesday press conference.\n",
      "Hydroxychloroquine has become a fixture among right-wing media and anti-lockdown activists following Trump’s early promotion of the drug in March as a “game changer.” Although the drug is still being studied, several high-quality studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine provides no benefit in treating COVID-19. Both the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health have warned about use of the drug or abandoned trials due to unlikelihood of success, and the government’s own top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, stated on Tuesday that evidence suggests it is not an effective treatment.\n",
      "“The overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease,” Fauci said.\n",
      "The America’s Frontline Doctors group heavily promoted the use of the drug at their event, which was organized by Tea Party Patriots, a wealthy Republican donor-backed nonprofit organization that has partnered with other right-wing dark money groups to form a coalition pushing for the rapid reopening of the United States economy.\n",
      "Many of those groups, including Tea Party Patriots itself, received substantial funding from the conservative megadonor Charles Koch and his late brother David. Marc Short, Pence’s chief of staff who also attended the meeting, was a longtime president of Freedom Partners, which is the Koch political operation’s main fundraising vehicle.\n",
      "There was no mention from the group’s social media if the Pence meeting included Dr. Stella Immanuel, an evangelical minister and pediatrician who has promoted bizarre claims that extraterrestrial DNA is used in medical treatments, blamed satanic influence for a range of ills and warned that dream-world sex with demons can make you sick. Immanuel claimed during the press conference to have cured hundreds of patients using hydroxychloroquine, but has provided no proof for her statements.\n",
      "Trump, whose reelection chances have grown increasingly poor as the pandemic goes on and case numbers in the United States continue to grow, has returned to promoting hydroxychloroquine as a potential quick fix solution. Trump offered support for the doctors group and specifically described Immanuel as “very impressive” during his Tuesday press conference.\n",
      "As Trump offered praise for the fringe group, coronavirus deaths in the United States surpassed 150,000 people on Wednesday, the largest death toll in the world and one of the highest rates per capita. Several states reported record-high average deaths this week, as cases continued to surge.\n",

      "“Hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of coronavirus disease or COVID-19,” Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on MSNBC on Wednesday. He cited the results of numerous clinical trials that he said have “consistently” shown this.\n",
      "“If a study that’s a good study comes out and shows efficacy and safety for hydroxychloroquine or any other drug that we do, if you do it in the right way, you accept the scientific data,” said Fauci, a key member of Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force. “But right now today, the cumulative scientific data that has been put together, and done over a number of different studies, has shown no efficacy.”\n",

      "That endorsement followed Trump retweeting a video that called the drug “a cure” for the disease. That video has since been removed from social media platforms after it was determined to contain misleading information.\n",

Several vaccines moved into large-scale Phase 3 trials last week and Dr. Anthony Fauci has said he was cautiously optimistic a vaccine could be available by the end of the year or early 2021.
